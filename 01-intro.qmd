*Which examples for digital trace data you know?* ü§î

:::

## What is digital trace data?

**Definition** üí°: *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena*

-   e.g., tweets, likes, shares on social media
-   e.g., geo data (locations, movements)
-   e.g., digital payments
-   e.g., Spotify playlists

## What is digital trace data?

**Definition** üí°: *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena*

-   e.g., tweets, **likes**, shares on social media

**Example: Instagram Like**

## What is digital trace data?

**Definition** üí°: *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena*

-   e.g., tweets, **likes**, shares on social media

**Example: Instagram Like**

![](images/instagram-2.JPG){fig-alt="Data behind Instagram Like" fig-align="left" width="200"}

## Where can we find/collect digital trace data?

-   Apps (e.g., running apps)
-   Social media platforms (e.g., Instagram)
-   Payment systems (e.g., Paypal)
-   Wearable devices (e.g., smart watch)

## Which types of data does this include?

Depending on the data collection method... [@stollfus_computational_2023; @ohme_digital_2024]:

- often fine-grained (e.g., time-stamped)
- often longitudinal (e.g., over years, within-individual change)
- often less reactive (e.g., less concerns about social desirability)

## Which (latent) constructs can we measure?

-   **Internet use** [@parry_etal2021] related to ...
    -   well-being [@ohme_digital_2024]
    -   voting [@bach_etal2021]
-   **News engagement** [@reiss_2023] related to ...
    -   news diversity [@juergens_etal2022]
    -   public opinion formation [@yan_etal2022]
-   **Movements** related to ...
    -   Mobility during pandemics [@li_etal2021]
    -   Social networks [@sepulvado_etal2022]

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   Problems with self-reported data (e.g., via survey)

"How many minutes a day do you use the internet to consume news?"

![Source: Image by Scott Graham via Unsplash](images/survey.jpg){fig-alt="image of human filling out survey" fig-align="left" width="300"}

- ‚Äûinternet"?
- ‚Äûnews"?
- ‚Äûhow many minutes"?

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   **Problems with self-reported data** (e.g., via survey)
    -   Self-reported data subject to specific bias [@scharkow_accuracy_2016; @parry_etal2021]
    -   Response rates in surveys are declining [@luiten_survey_2020]

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   **Problems with self-reported data** (e.g., via survey)
-   **Availabillity**
    -   cheap (e.g., via APIs)
    -   large data sets ("big data")

**Be careful**: These "advantages" are often claimed, but **not** empirically proven.

Digital traces are neither necessarily less biased, nor cheaper, or larger (we will discuss this in Session 4Ô∏è‚É£).

## (Dis-)advantages of digital trace data

-   ‚úÖ More fine-grained, often longitudinal measures due to timestamps
-   ‚úÖ Partly measurement of new variables (e.g., algorithmic inference)
-   ‚ùå Bias due to errors in representation and measurement
-   ‚ùå Implementation can be expensive and cumbersome
-   ‚ùå More data does not mean better data!

## Summary: What is digital trace data? üìö

-   **Definition**: *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena*

-   **Further literature**

Which methods do you know/have you used for collecting digital trace data*?* ü§î

:::

## Platform- and user-centric methods

-   **Platform-centric** (based on platform cooperation)
    -   API [@engel_brief_2021]
    -   Cooperation with platforms [@wagner_etal2023]
-   **User-centric** (based on user cooperation and informed consent) or "follow the user" approaches [@caliandro_2024]
    -   Data donation [@carriere_etal2024]
    -   Linkage [@sloan_etal2020]
    -   Sensors [@struminskaya_etal2021]
    -   Tracking [@christner_etal2022]

## Platform- and user-centric methods

-   Restrictions of platform-centric methods
    -   Discontinuation of APIs [@freelon_2018]
    -   Concerns about bias [@schatto-eckrodt_2022; @ulloa_etal2025]
-   User-centric methods become more popular, given ...
    -   Changes in law that enable such studies (GDPR, DSA)
    -   Presumably (!) less biased data
    -   Ethical considerations (informed consent)

## Summary: How can we collect digital traces? üìö

-   **Summary**

    -   Central methods including platform-centric methods (e.g., APIs) and user-centric methods (e.g., data donation)

    -   Key differences: control over samples & measurements, legal & ethical contexts

-   **Further literature**
