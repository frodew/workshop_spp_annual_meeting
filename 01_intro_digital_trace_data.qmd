A huge thanks to [Valerie Hase](https://valerie-hase.com), for conceptualizing a previous data donation workshop at CompText in Vienna.
:::

## What is the goal of this workshop?

- ‚úÖ Understanding digital data traces as a *type* of data
- ‚úÖ Understanding data donation as a *method* of data access
- ‚úÖ Working through key steps of data donation methods (participant & researcher view)
- ‚ùì Discussing when (not) to use data donation studies
- ‚ùå Detailed implementation (e.g., server set-up, coding data extraction scripts)

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is digital trace data?

::: {.v-center}
ü§î Which examples for digital trace data you know?
:::

## What is digital trace data?

üí° **Definition:** *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena.*

This might include:

- Tweets, likes, shares on social media
- Geo data (locations, movements)
- Digital payments
- Spotify playlists

## Where can we find/collect digital trace data?

- Apps (e.g., running apps)
- Social media platforms (e.g., Instagram)
- Payment systems (e.g., Paypal)
- Wearable devices (e.g., smart watch)

::: {.notes}
Depending on the data collection method... [[@ohme_etal2024]]{.cite}:

- Often fine-grained (e.g., time-stamped)
- Often longitudinal (e.g., over years, within-individual change)
- Often less reactive (e.g., less concerns about social desirability)
:::

## Which (latent) constructs can we measure?

- **Internet use** [[@parry_etal2021]]{.cite} related to ...
  - Well-being [[@ohme_etal2024]]{.cite} or voting [[@bach_etal2021]]{.cite}
- **News engagement** [[@reiss2023]]{.cite} related to ...
  - News diversity [[@jurgens_stark2022]]{.cite} or public opinion formation [[@yan_etal2022]]{.cite}
- **Movements** related to ...
  - Mobility during pandemics [[@li_etal2021]]{.cite} or social networks [[@sepulvado_etal2022]]{.cite}

::: {.notes}
ü§î How many minutes a day do you use the internet to consume news?

- ‚ÄûInternet"?

- ‚ÄûNews"?

- ‚ÄûHow many minutes"?
:::

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

- **Problems with self-reported data** (e.g., via survey)
  - Self-reported data subject to specific bias [[@scharkow2016; @parry_etal2021]]{.cite}
  - Response rates in surveys are declining [[@luiten_etal2020]]{.cite}
- **Availabillity**
  - Cheap (e.g., via APIs)
  - Large data sets ("big data")

::: {.v-center}
‚ö†Ô∏è **Be careful**: These "advantages" are often claimed, but **not** empirically proven.

üëâ Digital traces are neither necessarily less biased, cheaper, or larger.
:::

## (Dis-)advantages of digital trace data

- ‚úÖ More fine-grained, often longitudinal measures due to timestamps
- ‚úÖ Partly measurement of new variables (e.g., algorithmic inference)
- ‚ùå Bias due to errors in representation and measurement
- ‚ùå Implementation can be expensive and cumbersome
- ‚ùå More data does not mean better data!

# How can we collect digital traces?

## Platform- and user-centric methods

- **Platform-centric** (based on platform cooperation)
  - API [[@junger2021]]{.cite}
  - Cooperation with platforms [[@wagner2023]]{.cite}
- **User-centric** (based on user cooperation and informed consent) or "follow the user" approaches [[@caliandro2024]]{.cite}
  - Data donation [[@carriere_etal2025]]{.cite}
  - Linkage [[@sloan_etal2020]]{.cite}
  - Sensors [[@struminskaya_etal2021]]{.cite}
  - Tracking [[@christner_etal2022]]{.cite}

::: {.notes}
- Restrictions of platform-centric methods
  - Discontinuation of APIs
  - Concerns about bias
- User-centric methods become more popular, given ...
  - Changes in law that enable such studies (GDPR, DSA)
  - Presumably (!) less biased data
  - Ethical considerations (informed consent)
