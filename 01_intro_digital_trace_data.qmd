## What is the goal of this workshop?

- ‚úÖ Understanding digital data traces as a *type* of data
- ‚úÖ Understanding data donation as a *method* of data access
- ‚úÖ Working through key steps of data donation methods (participant & researcher view)
- ‚ùì Discussing when (not) to use data donation studies
- ‚ùå Detailed implementation (e.g., server set-up, coding data extraction scripts)

ü§î Which examples for digital trace data you know?

:::

## What is digital trace data?

üí° **Definition:** *The recording and storing of activities on digital platforms to draw conclusions about digital and analog phenomena*

-   e.g., tweets, likes, shares on social media
-   e.g., geo data (locations, movements)
-   e.g., digital payments
-   e.g., Spotify playlists

## Where can we find/collect digital trace data?

-   Apps (e.g., running apps)
-   Social media platforms (e.g., Instagram)
-   Payment systems (e.g., Paypal)
-   Wearable devices (e.g., smart watch)

## Which types of data does this include?

Depending on the data collection method... [[@ohme_etal2024]]{.cite}:

- often fine-grained (e.g., time-stamped)
- often longitudinal (e.g., over years, within-individual change)
- often less reactive (e.g., less concerns about social desirability)

## Which (latent) constructs can we measure? {.smaller}

-   **Internet use** [[@parry_etal2021]]{.cite} related to ...
    -   well-being [[@ohme_etal2024]]{.cite}
    -   voting [[@bach_etal2021]]{.cite}
-   **News engagement** [[@reiss2023]]{.cite} related to ...
    -   news diversity [[@jurgens_stark2022]]{.cite}
    -   public opinion formation [[@yan_etal2022]]{.cite}
-   **Movements** related to ...
    -   Mobility during pandemics [[@li_etal2021]]{.cite}
    -   Social networks [[@sepulvado_etal2022]]{.cite}

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

## Why are digital traces becoming more popular?

-   **Problems with self-reported data** (e.g., via survey)
    -   Self-reported data subject to specific bias [[@scharkow2016; @parry_etal2021]]{.cite}
    -   Response rates in surveys are declining [[@luiten_etal2020]]{.cite}
-   **Availabillity**
    -   cheap (e.g., via APIs)
    -   large data sets ("big data")

---

‚ö†Ô∏è **Be careful**: These "advantages" are often claimed, but **not** empirically proven.

üëâ Digital traces are neither necessarily less biased, nor cheaper, or larger.

## (Dis-)advantages of digital trace data

-   ‚úÖ More fine-grained, often longitudinal measures due to timestamps
-   ‚úÖ Partly measurement of new variables (e.g., algorithmic inference)
-   ‚ùå Bias due to errors in representation and measurement
-   ‚ùå Implementation can be expensive and cumbersome
-   ‚ùå More data does not mean better data!

# How can we collect digital traces?

## Platform- and user-centric methods

-   **Platform-centric** (based on platform cooperation)
    -   API [[@junger2021]]{.cite}
    -   Cooperation with platforms [[@wagner2023]]{.cite}
-   **User-centric** (based on user cooperation and informed consent) or "follow the user" approaches [[@caliandro2024]]{.cite}
    -   Data donation [[@carriere_etal2025]]{.cite}
    -   Linkage [[@sloan_etal2020]]{.cite}
    -   Sensors [[@struminskaya_etal2021]]{.cite}
    -   Tracking [[@christner_etal2022]]{.cite}

::: {.notes}

-   Restrictions of platform-centric methods
    -   Discontinuation of APIs
    -   Concerns about bias
-   User-centric methods become more popular, given ...
    -   Changes in law that enable such studies (GDPR, DSA)
    -   Presumably (!) less biased data
    -   Ethical considerations (informed consent)
