# 3Ô∏è‚É£ What is data donation?

The researcher's perspective.

---

::: {.v-center}
ü§î What are methodological decisions researchers have to take in data donation studies?
:::

## üîë Key decisions

- Which theoretical questions do I want to answer?
- How do I operationalize key variables via my data donation tool?
- How do I integrate the tool in surveys & recruit participants?

- **Goal**: Feasability to implement data donation in a labor market panel, develop best-use practices, and understand non-response bias
- **Issues**: Data availability, low response rates and bias (e.g., [[@keusch_etal2024]]{.cite})
    - Behavioral intentions as \"willingness to donate\" high (79-52% of survey respondents)
    - Actual behavior as \"participation in data donation\" low (37-12% of survey respondents)
    - Well known intention-behavior gap; where ü§ë seems to help [[@kmetty_etal2025]]{.cite}
- **Sample**: A non-probability panel (online access panel)
:::
::::

## {{< fa square-poll-horizontal >}} Survey

- Survey concerning...
  - online platform usage (YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn),
  - labor market characteristics,
  - and common indicators for non-participation.

# {{< fa file-arrow-down >}} Data request & download

# {{< fa spinner >}} Data extraction

## üõ†Ô∏è Strategy to make the extraction work

1. Take a look at the DDP; download it, best for multiple time periods and for different languages
2. Understand the structure of the JSON or CSV.
3. Get an example file running.
4. Write the code for the extraction script.
5. Test your script, first locally and then in the wild.
6. Adapt your script.

**üì¢ Task: Try it yourself.**
\
\
Take a look at your downloaded data. What do you see; anything caught your eye?
\
\
Feel free to work in groups of 2-3 people for 5 minutes.

Different degrees in standardization for DDP content [[@hase_etal2024]]{.cite}...

- Documentation
  - DDP structure?
  - Measurements?

- Completeness & scope
  - Missing data?
  - Limited time frames?
  - Language sensitive?

## üö® Key issues  [[@hase_etal2024]]{.cite}

-   Missing documentation by platforms (e.g., file structure)
-   Sudden changes in DDPs
-   Differences across languages & devices
-   Insufficient in-tool classification (e.g., LLM integration)

## Example: Extract list of subscriptions

![subscriptions.csv (before processing)](images/subscriptions_csv.png){fig-align="left" width="200"}

---

```{.python}
...
    "subscriptions": {
        "extraction_function": ef.extract_subscriptions,
        "possible_filenames": ["Abos.csv", "subscriptions.csv"],
        "title": {
            "en": "Which channels are you subscribed to?",
            "de": "Welche Kan√§le haben Sie abonniert?",
            "nl": "Op welke kanalen ben je geabonneerd?",
        },
    },
...
```

---

```{.python code-line-numbers="1-20"}
def extract_youtube_content_from_zip_folder(zip_file_path, possible_filenames):
    """Extract content from YouTube data export zip file using filenames"""

    try:
        with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_path, "r") as zip_ref:
            # Get the list of file names in the zip file
            filenames = zip_ref.namelist()
            # Look for matching files
            for possible_filename in possible_filenames:
                for filename in filenames:
                    if possible_filename in filename:
                        try:
                            # Process based on file extension
                            if filename.endswith(".json"):
                                with zip_ref.open(filename) as json_file:
                                    json_content = json.loads(json_file.read())
                                    return json_content
                            elif file_name.endswith(".csv"):
                                with zip_ref.open(file_name) as csv_file:
                                    csv_content = pd.read_csv(csv_file)
```

---

```{.python code-line-numbers="1-15"}
def extract_subscriptions(subscriptions_csv):
    """Extract YouTube channel subscriptions"""

    # Define column name
    if "Kanaltitel" in subscriptions_csv.columns:
        channel_column = "Kanaltitel"
    else:
        channel_column = "Channel Title"

    # Define description
    channel_name = "Subscribed Channel"

    # Create DataFrame with just the channel names
    subscriptions_df = pd.DataFrame({channel_name: subscriptions_csv[channel_column]})
    return subscriptions_df
```

# {{< fa magnifying-glass-chart >}} Data inspection

# {{< fa square-check >}} Data donation

- A data donation platform helps to guide them through the process
- The process should be made as easy as possible for participants

## üìö Workshop Takeaways

- There are many ways in which researchers can learn about people's online behavior through digital trace data
- People can request, download and finally donate their (anonymized) data form most online platforms
- Data donation can be burdensome for participants
- Data quailty heavily depends on the platform and what kind of data you extract from participants

::: {.v-center}
üôÉ Thank you for participating; happy to talk with you about data donation (and anything else) throughout the next days.
:::

## EXTRA: Can I extend the data?

-   Manual annotation by participants during data donation
-   APIs/scraping to extend collected data
-   Text-as-data methods for classification

## EXTRA: Errors in representation

For example ...

-   **Coverage error**: Who is (not) represented in the sampling frame? (e.g., social media users vs. YouTube users)
-   **Sampling error**: Who is (not) represented in the sample? (e.g., non-probability samples)
-   **Non-response error**: Who does (not) want to participate in the data donation?
-   **Compliance error**: Who is (not) able to participate in the data donation?

---

::: {.v-center}
ü§î What do you think: Which participant characteristics may correlate with non-response or non-compliance?
:::

# EXTRA: What's next for data donation studies?

## Advancing the method

-   üì∏ Multimodal & cross-platform data [[@wedel_etal2024]]{.cite}
-   In-tool, local classification (e.g., local ML/LLMs?)
-   Workflow/UX-perspective

## Data as a political tool

-   Platforms do (willingly?) not provide data according to the GDPR/DSA [[@hase_etal2024]]{.cite}
-   The EU has started to sanction platforms like X/TikTok
-   DSA may become the subject of larger geo-political debates with the USA [[@seiling_etal2025]]{.cite}

## üöÄ Can we improve & apply the method?

-   Can the method actually be applied for empirical research? (few examples, like [[@thorson_etal2021; @wojcieszak_etal2024]]{.cite})
-   Requires interdisciplinary perspectives (e.g., addressing bias, integration in probability-based panels)
