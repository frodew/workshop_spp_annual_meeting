## About

This workshop introduces data donation as a user-centric method for collecting digital trace data. Participants learn about:

- Digital trace data and its applications in social science research
- Data donation from the participant perspective (requesting, downloading, and donating data)
- Data donation from the researcher perspective (designing studies, extracting data, and addressing methodological challenges)

Workshop led by Frieder Rodewald (University of Mannheim & Institute for Employment Research) and Sebastian Prechsl (Institute for Employment Research & LMU Munich) as part of the DFG project "Integrating Data Donations in Survey Infrastructure".
