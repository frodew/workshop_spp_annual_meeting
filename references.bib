  abstract = {A major concern arising from ubiquitous tracking of individuals' online activity is that algorithms may be trained to predict personal sensitive information, even for users who do not wish to reveal such information. Although previous research has shown that digital trace data can accurately predict sociodemographic characteristics, little is known about the potentials of such data to predict sensitive outcomes. Against this background, we investigate in this article whether we can accurately predict voting behavior, which is considered personal sensitive information in Germany and subject to strict privacy regulations. Using records of web browsing and mobile device usage of about 2,000 online users eligible to vote in the 2017 German federal election combined with survey data from the same individuals, we find that online activities do not predict (self-reported) voting well in this population. These findings add to the debate about users' limited control over (inaccurate) personal information flows.},

  abstract = {In this article, I introduce a novel epistemological approach meant to re-adapt the digital methods paradigm to a fast changing digital landscape. This change was mostly brought about by the transformation of Web 2.0 into a platformized social media environment and the advent of the post-API and platform surveillance era. This approach is premised on the idea of considering the Internet user as a source of methods, rather than an object of study. To this purpose I suggest to ` follow the user', meaning to take advantage of the natively digital methods that Internet users employ to gather, organise, manage and create their own digital data throughout their everyday digital practices. In order to illustrate my approach, I show how to practically follow the users in each of the key phases of a digital research project within social media platforms: keywords selection, data collection, data sampling, data analysis. In doing so, I mean to contribute to an emerging strand of research within the digital methods tradition which is trying to: (a) update digital methods, given the continuous mutations of the digital landscape; (b) seek a more organic and systematic integration of digital and qualitative methods; (c) go beyond the classical quali-quanti dichotomy.},

  abstract = {Digital trace data form a rich, growing source of data for social sciences and humanities. Data donation offers an innovative and ethical approach to collect these digital trace data. In data donation studies, participants request a copy of the digital trace data a data controller (e.g., large digital social media or video platforms) collected about them. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation obliges platforms to provide such a copy. Next, the participant can choose to share (part of) this data copy with the researcher. This way, the researcher can obtain the digital trace data of interest with active consent of the participant. Setting up a data donation study involves several steps and considerations. If executed poorly, these steps might threaten a study's quality. In this paper, we introduce a workflow for setting up a robust data donation study. This workflow is based on error sources identified in the Total Error Framework for data donation by Boeschoten et al. (2022a) as well as on experiences in earlier data donation studies by the authors. The workflow is discussed in detail and linked to challenges and considerations for each step. We aim to provide a starting point with guidelines for researchers seeking to set up and conduct a data donation study.},

  abstract = {Research into digital platforms has become increasingly difficult. One way to overcome these difficulties is to build on data access rights in EU data protection law, which requires platforms to offer users a copy of their data. In data donation studies, researchers ask study participants to exercise this right and donate their data to science. However, there is increasing evidence that platforms do not comply with designated laws. We first discuss the obligations of data access from a legal perspective (with accessible, transparent, and complete data as key requirements). Next, we compile experiences from social scientists engaging in data donation projects as well as a study on data request/access. We identify 14 key challenges, most of which are a consequence of non-compliance by platforms. They include platforms' insufficient adherence to (a) providing data in a concise and easily accessible form (e.g. the lack of information on when and how subjects can access their data); (b) being transparent about the content of their data (e.g. the lack of information on measures); and (c) providing complete data (e.g. the lack of all available information platforms process related to platform users). Finally, we formulate four central recommendations for improving the right to access.},

In today's high-choice media environments, exposure to diverse news is largely determined by individuals' personal selection. Yet these decisions are increasingly shaped by online platforms, whose curation mechanisms may serve to expand or contract the diversity of encountered content. In a major extension of existing research, we show that positive short-term effects of platforms mask detrimental long-term effects. Drawing on a four-month tracking dataset and a comprehensive content analysis covering the online news consumption of over 10,000 German citizens, we demonstrate that even though short-term usage of platforms uniformly increases exposure diversity, long-term reliance can lead to decreases. In addition, platforms vary in their influences: News aggregators are beneficial to exposure diversity, while Twitter and search engines have a limiting effect; Facebook offers no significant influence.},

Nevertheless, given the novelty of this approach, little is known about whether and how people would share their data with researchers, although this could seriously affect selection bias and thus, the outer validity of the results. To study the determinants of data-sharing and help future data donation studies with detecting the conditions, under which the willingness is the highest, we pre-registered two vignette experiments and embedded them in two online surveys conducted in Hungary and the US. In hypothetical requests for donating social media data via DDPs, we manipulated the amount of the monetary incentives (1), the presence or lack of non-monetary incentives (2), the number of requested platforms (3), the estimated upload/download time (4), and the type of requested data (5). The results revealed that data-sharing attitude is strongly subject to the parameters of the actual study, how the request is framed, and some respondent characteristics. Monetary incentives increased willingness to participate in both countries, while other effects were not consistent between the two countries.},

Traditionally, the human mobility data is collected by roadside sensors, which have limited spatial coverage and are insufficient in large-scale studies. With the maturing of mobile sensing and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, various crowdsourced data sources are emerging, paving the way for monitoring and characterizing human mobility during the pandemic. This paper presents the authors' opinions on three types of emerging mobility data sources, including mobile device data, social media data, and connected vehicle data. We first introduce each data source's main features and summarize their current applications within the context of tracking mobility dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, we discuss the challenges associated with using these data sources. Based on the authors' research experience, we argue that data uncertainty, big data processing problems, data privacy, and theory-guided data analytics are the most common challenges in using these emerging mobility data sources. Last, we share experiences and opinions on potential solutions to address these challenges and possible research directions associated with acquiring, discovering, managing, and analyzing big mobility data.},

Still, international comparative studies have been scarce. In one of the first international trend analyses for the period 1980--1997, De Leeuw and De Heer (2002) describe that response rates declined over the years and that countries differed in response rates and nonresponse trends. In this article, we continued where De Leeuw and De Heer (2002) stopped, and present trend data for the next period 1998--2015 from National Statistical Institutes. When we looked at trends over time in this new data set, we found that response rates are still declining over the years. Furthermore, nonresponse               trends               do differ over countries, but not over surveys. Some countries show a steeper decline in response than others, but all types of surveys show the same downward trend. The differences in (non)response trends over countries can be partly explained by differences in survey design between the countries. Finally, for some countries cost indicators were available, these showed that costs increased over the years and are negatively correlated with noncontact rates.},

Moving beyond this approach, a burgeoning line of research is investigating temporal dyadic similarity on traits and behaviors, such as health activities. Our study contributes to this line of inquiry by using fine-grained longitudinal data obtained from sensors, mobile devices, and surveys to examine whether we can observe distinct types of dyadic similarity trajectories based on physical activity, and if so, what dyad-level properties predict membership in each trajectory class. Treating daily differences in the steps for dyads as time series, we use k-shape clustering to identify classes of similarity trajectories and logistic regression to examine the link between trajectory class and key dyad-level factors. We identify 21 dyadic trajectory clusters and find that trajectory membership predicts dyadic connectivity in the communication network, as well as racial and religious---but not gender-based---similarity. We conclude by noting how research on dyadic similarity trajectories can be further integrated with ongoing work in social network analysis.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Smartphone sensors allow measurement of phenomena that are difficult or impossible to capture via self-report (e.g., geographical movement, physical activity). Sensors can reduce respondent burden by eliminating survey questions and improve measurement accuracy by replacing/augmenting self-reports. However, if respondents who are not willing to collect sensor data differ on critical attributes from those who are, the results can be biased. Research on the mechanisms of willingness to collect sensor data mostly comes from (nonprobability) online panels and is hypothetical (i.e., asks participants about the likelihood of participation in a sensor-based study). In a cross-sectional general population randomized experiment, we investigate how features of the request and respondent characteristics influence willingness to share (WTS) and actually sharing smartphone-sensor data. We manipulate the request to either mention or not mention (1) how participation will benefit the participant, (2) participants' autonomy over data collection, and (3) that data will be kept confidential. We assess nonparticipation bias using the administrative records. WTS and actually sharing varies by sensor task, participants' autonomy over data sharing, their smartphone skills, level of privacy concerns, and attitudes toward surveys. Fewer people agree to share photos and a video than geolocation, but all who agreed to share photos or a video actually did. Some nonresponse and nonparticipation biases are substantial and make each other worse, but others jointly reduce the overall bias. Our findings suggest that sensor-data-sharing decisions depend on sample members' situation when asked to share and the nature of the sensor task rather than the sensor type.},

  abstract = {Industry--academy collaboration explores the 2020 US election           ,                             In the spring of 2020, pressed by internal research staff and with support from the highest levels of the company, Facebook (now Meta) began a collaboration with outside academics to study the 2020 US presidential election. Interest in social media's role in elections came after evidence that the 2016 US election was rife with suspicious and divisive groups targeting swing-state residents on Facebook (                                1                              ). As one of the initiatives the team used to demonstrate transparency, I was approached to serve as the project's independent rapporteur. I conclude that the team conducted rigorous, carefully checked, transparent, ethical, and path-breaking studies---reported by Gonz{\'a}lez-Bail{\'o}n               et al.               (                                2                              ) and Guess               et al.               (                                3                              ,                                4                              ) on pages 392, 398, and 404 of this issue, respectively, and by Nyhan               et al.               (                                5                              )---in the first public results of this project. Though the work is trustworthy, I argue that the project is not a model for future industry--academy collaborations. The collaboration resulted in independent research, but it was independence by permission from Meta.},

  abstract = {This research explores the potential of augmented Data Download Packages (aDDPs) as a novel approach to analyze digital trace data, using TikTok as a use case to demonstrate the broader applicability of the method. The study demonstrates how these data packages can be used in social science research to understand better user behavior, content consumption patterns, and the relationship between self-reported preferences and actual digital behavior.We introduce the concept of aDDPs, which extend the conventional Data Download Packages (DDPs) by augmenting the collected data with survey data, metadata, content data, and multimodal content embeddings, among other possibilities - rendering aDDPs an unprecedentedly rich data source for social science research. This work provides an overview and guidance on collecting, augmenting DDPs, and analyzing the resulting aDDPs. In a pilot study on 18 aDDPs, we use the combination of data components in aDDPs to facilitate research on user engagement behavior and content classification. We showcase the potential of the information breadth and depth that aDDPs depict by exploiting the combination of multimodal content embeddings, the users' watch history, and survey data. To do so, we train and compare uni- and multimodal classifiers, classify the 18 aDDPs' videos, and investigate the extent to which user engagement behavior impacts future content suggestions. Furthermore, we compare the users retrieved content with the users' self-reported content consumption.},
