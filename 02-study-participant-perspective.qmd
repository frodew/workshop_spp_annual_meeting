## Session 2️⃣: Data Donation Studies (Participant Perspective)

👉 Part of the SPP DFG Project [Integrating Data Donations in Survey Infrastructure](https://data-donation-science.de)

## Agenda

1. **What are data donation studies?**

2. **Participant perspective**, including

   2.1 📢 **Task 1**: Inspect your DDPs

   2.2 📢 **Task 2**: Try donating your data

## Changes in legal contexts

-   EU secures right to own data in Art. 15 of the General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/))
    -   "The data subject shall have [...] access to the personal data" (§ Art. 15, 1)
    -   "The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data" (§ Art. 15, 3)
-   According to § Art. 20, users must receive their data "in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format" (§ Art. 20, 1)

👉 **Solution:** Platforms offer data download packages (DDPs), which users can request and download to inspect data.

👉 **Consequence**: Researchers uses DDPs as part of user-centric data donation studies.

## What are data donation studies?

**Definition** 💡: Data donation studies are a user-centric method for collecting digital traces:

- Users have the right to request, access, and download data that platforms collect about them.
- They can make their _data packages (DDPs)_ available to science via _data donation tools (DDTs)_, often in the context of surveys.
- Researchers use CSS methods to filter, anonymize, and aggregate this data locally on participants' devices.
- Participants can inspect/delete their data before any data is transferred.

## Which types of data do DDPs contain?

For platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube, for example... [@hase_etal2024]

- _User profiles_ (e.g., privacy settings)
- _Activities_ (e.g., friends, likes, searches, exposure, analog movements)
- _Content and context_ (e.g., ads watched, algorithmically inferred interests)

## How is data from DDPs different?

Compared to **APIs** [@stollfus_computational_2023; @ohme_digital_2024]...

- Control & informed consent of users
- Longitudinal data without "rate limits"
- Partly additional measurements (e.g., exposure data; non-public data)

## How is data from DDPs different?

Compared to **tracking** [@stollfus_computational_2023; @ohme_digital_2024]...

- Retrospective & often more longitudinal
- Partly additional measurements (e.g., algorithmic inferences)
- Anchored in current provisions in law [for issues with tracking, see @edelson_facebook_2021]

👉 but similarly burdensome for participants!

## Summary: What are data donation studies? 📚

-   **Summary**: User-centric method for collecting digital traces: Users download their data packages (DDPs) from platforms and make them available to science via data donation tools (DDTs).

*How easy (or hard) did you find it to request your data? Did you encounter any obstacles?* 🤔

:::

## Step I: Data request

Different degrees in standardization for data requests [@hase_etal2024]...

- Verification procedure
- Specification of data (metrics, observation period)
- Notification on provision of DDP
- Duration of DDP availability

## Step II: Download

**📢 Task 1: Inspect your DDPs.**

*Which variables can you identify? How could you use these for research in your field?*

Feel free to work in groups of 2-3 people.

:::

## Step II: Download

Different degrees in standardization for DDP content [@hase_etal2024]...

- Documentation
  - DDP structure?
  - Measurements?

- Completeness & scope

  - Missing data?
  - Limited time frames?
  - Language sensitive?

## Step III: Data donation

**📢 Task 2: Try donating your data.**

*Upload and inspect your data. Did you encounter any difficulties in sharing your data?*

Feel free to work in groups of 2-3 people.

## Bias in Data Donation Studies

Similar to tracking studies, data donation characterized by [@keusch_etal2024; @hase_etal2024; @hase_haim2024a]:

-   Errors in representation (e.g., coverage error, non-response error)
-   Measurement errors (e.g., missing data, specification error)

👉 Not necessarily less biased than survey data - but subject to different bias?

👉 We will talk about this in Session 4️⃣.

## Summary: Participant perspective 📚

-   **Summary**: Key steps from the participant perspective ...

    1.  Data request
    2.  Data download
    3.  Data donation
